## ðŸš€ Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd machine-learning
   ```  
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```  
4. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
5. Run the scripts for different algorithms as needed:  
   ```bash
   python scripts/linear_regression.py
   ```
